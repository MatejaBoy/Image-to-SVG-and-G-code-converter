# Image-to-SVG-and-G-code-converter
This app find contours on images (using openCV) and generates SVG or G-code from them. I this created to be able to draw images using my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer, so basically converting it to a plotter. The user can mess around with the detection parameters to find all the contours needed, then export an SVG or a single or multilayer G-code with a simple press of a button. Since it's written in Python, you're gonna need Python installed to use it. You get the whole Python code, so you can modify any function, like the G-code creation process. I written a HowToUse.txt which explains every feature and I used comments in the program code to make it easier to modify it. I attached some printscreens of the software, and also the final image drawn by my 3D printer.

I worked a lot with this project, so I'd like to see some support for it. The software can be downloaded from my Patreon for a  couple of bucks. Of course it's a one time payment.

Not saying this is best software for these purposes, but I couldn't find any other software with the same capabilities for a reasonable price, so I think it's not a lot to ask for it. Hope you be able to use my software, and thank you for your support in advance.

I attached some example files to help you choose whether you need this app or not. 

You can visualize the G-code files using: https://ncviewer.com
