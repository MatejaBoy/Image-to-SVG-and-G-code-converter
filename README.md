# Image-to-SVG-and-G-code-converter
This app find contours on images (using openCV) and generates SVG or G-code from them. I this created to be able to draw images using my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer, so basically converting it to a plotter. The user can mess around with the detection parameters to find all the contours needed, then export an SVG or a single or multilayer G-code with a simple press of a button. Since it's written in Python, you're gonna need Python installed to use it. You get the whole Python code, so you can modify any function, like the G-code creation process. I written a HowToUse.txt which explains every feature and I used comments in the program code to make it easier to modify it. I attached some printscreens of the software, and also the final image drawn by my 3D printer.

I attached some example files and higher resouliton images of the UI to help you choose whether you need this app or not. 
You can visualize the uploaded G-code files using: https://ncviewer.com

If you'd like to give it a try, the software is downloadble from my hackaday page on this link:
